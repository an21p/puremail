# puremail

- Admin can mark as received
- User can subscribe/unsubscribe for email notifications
- When adding parcel email notification send (if enabled)


# TODO
- Parcel received date is when received is pressed
- Add email subscription to room
- once subscribed let session know so not asked to subscribe to another room
- send emails to all subscribed
- lock down admin views


3. solve the multiple email problem (read below)

if someone has claimed the room how to avoid people changing the email without permission

also contrary to above what if the person left and then someone else wants to claim the room

- Solution to number 3: table for emails, table for rooms, table for subscriptions that links rooms to emails

- once subscribed let session know so not asked to subscribe to another room
- add subscription box on the room page
